# Multiplayer Beats

A collaborative beat-making game where two players take turns building a track on a FL Studio-style step sequencer.

## How It Works

1. **Create or join a room** - Share the room code with a friend
2. **Take turns** - Each player gets 60 seconds per turn
3. **Add to the beat** - Click the grid to add drum hits
4. **Build together** - Round after round, alternate turns creating a full track

## Tech Stack
